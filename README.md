#Summary 

To see these skills, we would like to see you: 

·         Set up an AWS account (we will ask for access, so not your personal account) 
·         Set up AWS-managed Elasticsearch in a VPC 
·         Pick a web server container image (Nginx/Apache/whatever) and deploy/run in AWS behind an ELB (default welcome page is fine) 
·         Configure container logs/access logs to go to ES (Elasticsearch) 
·         Use Terraform to build as much of the infrastructure as you can 
·         Code in a public git repo that is used to create the infrastructure
·         Include a file in your repo that includes your suggestions on potential security concerns that affect your configuration 

What we are mainly looking for:  
·         Best practices and security considerations in AWS 
·         Automation through Terraform or other means 
·         Git repo setup integration 
·         Preferences for tooling/methodology 

Bonus points, but not required: 
·         CI Integration with the git repos to deploy 
·         Use Kubernetes (EKS) 
·         Turn in early 
·         Cloud Trail logs going to ES
